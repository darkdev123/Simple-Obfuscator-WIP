# SimpleVM
Will be adding new features and adding a deserializer so it doesn't get the chunk immediately.

Add me on Discord if you need help:

sultragamer

(no tag)

Info:

Currently i only have a sample of it (which was coded manually lol), but I will be uploading things onto this repo like the actual obfuscation process when I have learnt how a Lua VM works (better).

Features:

VM Generator (extremely simple),
Custom VM (extremely simple too),
Macros (currently doesn't work)

Also, if you are gonna add me on Discord to argue with me that "this isn't a real obfuscator", it is it's just development.
