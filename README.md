If you want the update / info list from this discontinued obfuscator, read below.
# SimpleVM
Will be adding new features and adding a deserializer so it doesn't get the chunk immediately.

Add me on Discord if you need help:

sultragamer

(no tag)

Info:

Currently i only have a sample of it (which was coded manually lol), but I will be uploading things onto this repo like the actual obfuscation process when I have learnt how a Lua VM works (better).

Features:

VM Generator (extremely simple),
Custom VM (extremely simple too),
Macros (currently doesn't work)

Also, if you are gonna add me on Discord to argue with me that "this isn't a real obfuscator", it is it's just development.

Finally decided to update this obfuscator thing, I still haven't added a deserializer, if you're mad about that, your problem. Not mine.

Update log:
Changed the VM (not too much)
Added encryption (XOR)

Coming features:
SHA-256 / MD5 anti tamper (might go with SHA-256 since it is faster and i tried to hash a few things on a private obfuscator with MD5 and it make the execution speed minimum: 3 milliseconds which is a lot of time wasted during execution speed.)
Random encryption / decryption key when obfuscating.
